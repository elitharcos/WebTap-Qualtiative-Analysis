			<h2>WebTap Qualitative Analysis Main Page</h2>          
			<p class="welcomeMessage">
			Our webpage is designed to assist students as well as possibly workers by providing information about chemical reactions and what are the possible origins of the reactions that have been observed.<br>
			First to help in understanding we must discuss what <i>"qualitative analysis"</i> in chemistry.
			</p>
			<h3 class="welcomeMessage">What is qualitative analysis?</h3>
			<p class="welcomeMessage">
			Qualitative Analysis in chemistry means finding out the origin of a solution rather than the amounts needed to react.
			<br><br><b>Example:</b><br><br> let's say you know you have 3 liquids in your kitchen. You know that one of them is water. You have salt with yourself. You know that water solves salt. So you decide to put salt in your liquids. 1 of them doesn't solve it. So you are left with 2 liquids. Now you decide to pour oil on top of them because you know oil doesn't mix with water. It mixes with the other liquid however.
			From these datas you could conclude which one is the water. That is called qualitative analysis, because you didn't measure how much of something you needed, but what kind of thing you were looking for. 
			</p>
			<h3 class="welcomeMessage">So why is our website so important?</h3>
			<p class="welcomeMessage">
			As you may have seen above this is a simple example that an average person could do at home if they are creative enough and have the right liquids.
			But things can get rather complicated rather quickly when we look at chemicals. They have chemical structures and can often behave in a way that you may not guess at first sight what they are and we are not even talking about organic materials neither.
			Our website's database is designed to apply to reactions, by color changes, precipitate presence and all sorts of things regarding reactions that makes them more recognizable.
			For a chemist it could make their job easier by just having to look up at our table and see what reactions resemble a material.
			For a regular person it could ease their fear when they see something unexpected happen like "A kind of yellow liquid appeared" and they could look it up what it could be.
			</p>
			<h3 class="welcomeMessage">Conclusion</h3>
			<p class="welcomeMessage">
			In conclusion our website is here to assist with queries regarding reactions and help people understand more about their environment. They can look around our website and learn about chemistry as well as study and take guesses what happened to their liquids. I had to study this in 10th grade and it was one of the better classes I have had. It was fun and interesting and I think more people even less proficient should have access to a site like this.
